My submissions Advent of code 2025
- Day one took me quite some time, hopeful to improve
- Part two of day two was also challenging and the solution is inefficient. Will keep improving
- Improved on day 3 but still slower
- Improved on day 4 but need to think of a better solution
- Day 5 part 2 has been the most confusing so far, fixed it by adding test case for 9 - 21 as suggested by [Diligent-Error3772](https://www.reddit.com/user/Diligent-Error3772/). Thank you so much
- Day 6 part 2 took a lot of time and it is both memory and time inefficient, need to come up with a better algorithm
- For day 7 part 2, I could not come up with a sensible algorithm, I had to check the subreddit to see discussions. Apparently, while descending the tree, one can calculate all possibilities at each level. For part 2, I could not come up with a geniune solution unfortunately. Thank you [pacificpuzzleworks](https://www.reddit.com/user/pacificpuzzleworks/) for the [picture](https://preview.redd.it/2025-day-7-part-2-hint-v0-9lxea8kv9q5g1.gif?width=625&auto=webp&s=1aff8c97090bb5f5fd84efc2cd1d5b67f085eae1)
- Day 8 ws relatively easy to design but I got confused with the requirement specifically what a connection is. This made this day the longest so far
