My submissions Advent of code 2025
- Day one took me quite some time, hopeful to improve
- Part two of day two was also challenging and the solution is inefficient. Will keep improving
- Improved on day 3 but still slower
- Improved on day 4 but need to think of a better solution
- Day 5 part 2 has been the most confusing so far, fixed it by adding test case for 9 - 21 as suggested by [Diligent-Error3772](https://www.reddit.com/user/Diligent-Error3772/). Thank you so much
- Day 6 part 2 took a lot of time and it is both memory and time inefficient, need to come up with a better algorithm

.NET version - 10

Please run with `dotnet days/{day_of_code}/{file}.cs`
